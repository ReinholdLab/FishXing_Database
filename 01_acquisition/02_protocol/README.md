# FishXing Data Acquisition Protocol

This folder contains the following:

- **An R Markdown file:** This file holds the code and proceedures used to acquire the original FishXing data, mutate the data, and create new tables to be used in the updated database. It also provides a step-by-step  walkthrough of how these proceedures were executed.

- **A knitted Word document and an HTML page of the RMD file:** These are separate versions of the knitted RMD file containing the data wrangling work done in this stage of development.
