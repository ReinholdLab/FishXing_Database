# FishXing Data Acquisition Incremental

This folder contains some extra supplemental materials related to the FishXing data acquisition:

- **A CSV file version of the original FishXing database:** As mentioned in the RMD file in 02_protocol, the data and columns from the original database were copied into a CSV file that way the information could be read in easier without the risk of the original database losing its data entries.

- **The FishXing database relational model:** This PowerPoint file contains a diagram of the relational model created as the framework for how the updated FishXing database should look.
